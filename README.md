# Folkgheist Rendering Engine

This was my first attempt and a "big" software project and my first real attempt at 
game programming (not counting modding, or my elementary school attempt to clone 
Space Invaders in Basic).  I has a lot of bad code and worse achitecture, and was 
the repo was taken down for long time out of embarrassment.  However, like Digit 
Span Tester, or some of my small '90's commandline utilities I've come to see it as 
at least interesting to have around.  It is a thoroughly dead project to say the least.

The intention was to create a culture-simulating city-builder game ("Folkgheist"), or 
what I saw as "what SimCity Societies should have been."  What it is is a pair of flawed 
rendering engines, due to a total re-write at one point.  After finding that Minecraft 
had been written by one guy, in Java, in his spare time, I decided I'd give it a try, not 
considering that Notch might have had far more experience already when he start Minecraft.

Admittedly, the games design itself was flawed -- the plan giving neither the lever of 
control for expressive "building" play nor challenge much for challenge-oriented 
players. Beyond that the engine was not well designed to integrate with other game systems, or 
even to integrate the planned procedural terrains.

I may make another stab at an engine just to see how much better I can do now (but I might 
prefer a pre-made engine for a serious game making project).  However, a new engine 
would most likely start as C++ port and expansion from Knightferret Engine 0, to 
Knightferret Engine 1, followed by the addition of 3D rendering as a sub-system -- hypothetically,
at least.

Anyway, while this will have no further development here, anyone interested is free to use 
parts of it as they like under the MIT license should some part be seen as useful.
